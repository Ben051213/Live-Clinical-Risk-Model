Datathon for Social Good: A Deployed Clinical Risk Tool

This is the complete project submission for Track 1: Public Health Risk. We didn't just analyze data; we built a fully functional, end-to-end product that turns patient vitals into an instant, data-driven clinical recommendation.

Our project consists of two main components:

1. The Live Tool (Our Deployed Product)
This tool is a standalone website that runs our DecisionTree model's logic. It allows a clinician to input a new patient's vitals and get an instant, explainable risk assessment.

2. The "Mission Control" Dashboard
This Tableau dashboard integrates our live tool with analytics on the full dataset, providing a complete solution for "better resource allocation."
